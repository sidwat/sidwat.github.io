I was born in a small beautiful town, Jamshedpur in India. I pursued bachelor's of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering with a double major in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). My research interests lies in computer vision, robotics, deep learning, embedded systems and in general mathematical stuffs. Back in my college days, I led [team ERA](https://era.sntiitk.com/), a group focussed on real-time autonomous systems. After finishing my coursework, I joined [Robert Bosch Institute of Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore)](https://iisc.ac.in/) where I worked on imitation learning. I then joined [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore, India](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) where I am currently contributing to next generation video codec standards in AI Video processing Lab.
