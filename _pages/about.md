I was born in a small beautiful town, Jamshedpur in India. I pursued bachelor's of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering with a double major in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). My research interests lies in computer vision, robotics, deep learning, embedded systems and in general mathematical stuffs. Back in my college days, I led [https://era.sntiitk.com/](team ERA), a group focussed on real-time autonomous systems. After finishing my coursework, I joined [https://cps.iisc.ac.in/](Robert Bosch Institute of Cyber Physical Systems), [https://iisc.ac.in/](Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore)) where I worked on imitation learning. I then joined Samsung Research Institute Bangalore where I am currently contributing to next generation video codec standards in AI Video processing Lab.
