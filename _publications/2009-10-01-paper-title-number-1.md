excerpt: 'The unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) described in this manuscript is a robot designed by the authors to map the underground mine environments. The UGV works to develop a computational intelligence-based cyber-physical system (CPS)-based analytical framework for mining operations. The UGV demonstrated excellent semi-autonomous navigation capabilities in the absence of GNSS signals. The UGV has a suite that works in unison to provide relevant information. These sensors are integrated to form a robust sensor fusion-based architecture, creating a CPS with a wide range of capabilities such as data acquisition and navigation in challenging underground environments. UGVs can be used to enhance the efficacy of safety inspections, rescue during underground emergencies and assist miners in hazardous conditions.'
